                <p>Along with a passion for coding, I enjoy rock climbing, any team-based sport, and reading fantasy novels.  I was drawn to web development by the many influencers around me.  I have grown up in a home with a father who is a now retired CIO from Deseret Management and with three brothers that have enjoyed everything about technology. I found myself utilizing my excel coding skills in every aspect of life and realized that I wanted to code for a living and become a developer. I pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Database Administration but felt that it was lacking in providing me the coding experience I wanted.  I have since completed two IT Bootcamps for Web Development through DevMountain and U of U Trilogy Education. </p>
